						We had yet another Skype meeting and it occured early because I was still ill. We decided to have questionnaires to capture more user requirements.
						We still didn't settle on which application we were using i.e Website or mobile application. We deceided to schedule a meeting with Inzamam before making a  decision the meeting was scheduled for the 23rd October, 2019 during his office hours

						The meeting was scheduled for today. <br>
						Before the meeting, we hashed out the some of the requirements and deceided on the class diagram. We also weighed the pros and cons of developing either a website or a mobile application. I pointe out that I may not be able to help with the mobile application since I was not enrolled in the course but I would be of more help with the website development instead. Consideration was given to developing a hybrid (website connected to a mobile application).
            <br>
            I went to the meeting with the group. We addressed inzamam as we had some concerns about the direction of the project. He suggested that we try developing a Progressive web Application. I recorded the conversation and posted the suggestions in the Whatsapp group chat. We deceided to research what that was

						We had the meeting today. We spoke more about the requirements and I was tasked with creating the design of the application. While the other members were going to work on the implementation aspect. I was also tasked to research the "Login" feature of the applicatiom. Our initial idea was to use the exam scanner in UWI and its database to have the students swipe their card to login in at the gym. Access to the hardware or the database was rejected and we were told to use an online library and to use a barcode scanner to acheive the same effect.

						Throughout the project there were set backs being due to illness or other assignments. It was difficult to schedule meetings due to our personal schedule. Although the experience could have been better and I felt as if I could have contributed more, I will not mark it as a failure. I will use this opportunity to improve my skills especially in the areas that I lack in order to have growth. Communicating effectively was difficult at times but there was improvement as the course progressed
